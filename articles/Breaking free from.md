Can work, traffic, social media, noisy cities, and our busy lives consume our routines? That’s a lot to manage! We usually spend so much time doing stuff that gives us a quick sense of satisfaction, but in reality, it’s pure emptiness. That’s how cheap dopamine works. 

Understanding Digital Consumption 

Nowadays, the world is a whole of quick dopamine that consumes us in all senses. Social media addiction is driven by dopamine release, similar to the effects of gambling or drug use. Platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram are designed to stimulate the brain’s reward system through likes, shares, and retweets, reinforcing user engagement. Over time, excessive use can contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and stress due to the reliance on external validation from social media interactions. Thangavel, V. (2024) 

A couple of weeks ago, I read a newsletter from Cory Allen about the move to the information age.  We’re entering a quiet age. He talked about how exhausted and overloaded we are. That’s why we should move into a quiet age, reconnect with the earth and nature again, and return to our nature. 

Returning to Our Roots 

But how can we come back to our essence? That’s the key question. I’m part of the last generation where our childhood was full of connection with other kids, playing on the playground, and interacting with the world around us. That’s a huge advantage compared to the current generations, who are always in front of a screen. So it is easy for us to connect to our core again. 

In the Journal of Community Psychology, it is highlighted that doomscrolling negatively affects individuals’ mental health, leading to increased anxiety and depression. These findings underscore the potential mental health risks associated with prolonged exposure to harmful online content among youth. 

It’s not a secret that after the pandemic, the levels of anxiety and depression have been increasing, not only because of COVID-19 but also because of the huge exposure to devices and social media. 

A study published in the Journal of Consumer Affairs found that excessive social media use is driven more by implicit attitudes than explicit beliefs about consuming social media. This suggests that unconscious processes play a substantial role in the consumption patterns of heavy social media users. 

What does it mean for our daily lives? High exposure can affect our work and how we behave with others. Those are some reasons I decided to close my social media accounts and be with myself for a while. 

The Power of Social Media Detox 

I have lived without social media for the past three months and experienced so much wellness. According to the article: Characteristics of social media ‘detoxification’ in university students. Social media detoxification has been linked to improved mood, reduced anxiety, better productivity, and enhanced sleep quality. Participants in a study reported increased awareness of their social media habits and regained control over their digital consumption after detoxing, even if they eventually returned to social media (El-Khoury et al., 2021) 

Integrating Work and Purpose 

Not only can a social media detox connect you to nature again, but it can also find ways to integrate our jobs into our daily routine. I work for a climate NGO as a Digital and Marketing Analytics Specialist. Approximately five years ago, I decided to move from the corporate world and companies to start working in an impactful job beyond sales and money, and here I am, still working in an NGO and working in a field I studied. 

In my free time, I spend a significant amount of time on social media, which is common nowadays. This shift allowed me to pursue more fulfilling pursuits that align with my values and contribute positively to the planet. Reducing my social media usage has given me more time to dedicate to productive endeavors that resonate with my commitment to environmental sustainability.

Based on that, I started wondering how to return to my core and apply what I do at work daily — there were so many questions simultaneously. Then, I decided to get involved in the climate NGO work I usually do with one local project my dad has. 

A Sustainable Family Project 

Lights powered by solar panels 

I want to share a story about a project my dad initiated during the pandemic. He owned a piece of land that had been overlooked for years and wasn’t sure how to utilize it. Reflecting on how the pandemic reshaped our lives and diminished our connection to rural areas, he envisioned creating a glamping site to offer urban dwellers a chance to reconnect with nature. Recognizing the growing interest in glamping as a form of eco-tourism during the pandemic, he embarked on designing, building, and promoting this unique place. 

Throughout this process, I assisted him by managing the marketing and social media aspects and developing digital and offline strategies to bring this beautiful project to life. As part of the eco-tourism objective, we wanted to include solar panels as the place’s main energy source.  So, let’s get down to work! My dad investigated all the light sources; he is an expert on the topic, and we started illuminating all the external areas with lamps, light extensions, flashlights, and everything powered by solar energy. 

During this eco-friendly journey, we identified numerous benefits of utilizing solar energy. Beyond the reduction in costs which my dad greatly appreciated we also experienced several other advantages, such as: 

* Energy Independence 


* Low Maintenance Requirements 


* Improved Air Quality 


* Conservation of Water Resources 



Guests responded enthusiastically, wanting to replicate these eco-friendly practices in their homes. This sustainable approach not only increased guest satisfaction but also led to a significant improvement in our Booking.com ratings. So, my dad had the business and financial part covered, and on my side, I finally found a way to apply what I do at work to my personal life. 

Connecting the Dots 

In a world dominated by digital noise and constant connectivity, I decided to disconnect from social media, embarking on a journey toward a more balanced and meaningful life. This digital detox improved my mental well-being and allowed me to appreciate the beauty of reality often obscured by the digital world. 

Transitioning from the corporate sector to a role in a climate-focused NGO enabled me to align my professional skills with my passion for environmental sustainability, deepening my connection to my work. Collaborating with my father on his eco-tourism project further exemplified this integration, as we harnessed solar energy to create a sustainable retreat that resonated with guests seeking a deeper connection with nature. 

This experience strengthened our bond and reinforced my gratitude for having a profession that aligns with my life goals and personal mission, allowing me to contribute positively to the planet. By stepping away from superficial digital engagements, I rediscovered the importance of authentic experiences and purposeful work, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and harmonious lifestyle.

Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology.  We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling (VS)...
