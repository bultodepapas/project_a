## Introduction

It is no secret that LLMs are dominating online marketing; to position our brands and accounts, we need to stay one step ahead of digital trends. SEO is the protagonist of the new era of web positioning in marketing. Also, terms such as GEO and AEO were born in these AI times.

Let's start reviewing what an LLM is and how it works. Based on Harnad (2025), LLMs are defined as:

> "Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast text corpora using statistical learning over high-dimensional representations, capable of generating human-like language outputs, despite lacking sensorimotor grounding or genuine understanding."

In simple words, thanks to LLMs, we can get easy, fast, and reliable information wherever we want. Some of the most famous LLMs, like GPT, Perplexity, and Gemini, among others, are good examples here.

One of the things we need to admit is that LLMs, instead of taking our jobs, are helping us create a new digital structure for marketers and be even more innovative, strategic, and brilliant executors.

## How LLMs Collaborate with Marketing and SEO Practice

Here are some key highlights on how LLMs collaborate with SEO:

- Content creation and optimization for SEO (high-quality content with optimized keywords)
- Keyword research and targeting (identifying high-volume, low-competition keywords)
- Generation and optimization of meta descriptions and titles
- Technical SEO support (site architecture, loading speed, mobile optimization)
- Improvement of user engagement (reduced bounce rates, increased time on page)
- Increase in organic traffic performance
- Improvement in keyword rankings

## Strategy 1: Adopt a Wikipedia-style Structure

A practical way to improve brand visibility in the age of AI is to **structure content like Wikipedia**: clear, factual, and explanatory rather than long and narrative-heavy.

If you want your brand to appear in LLM answers, your content should look like a simple article that explains what the product is, what makes it special, and why it is different. Wikipedia does this exceptionally well through structured sections and easy-to-digest explanations.

People are no longer reading long theoretical articles. They consume **straightforward, concise explainer content**. This format works better for both humans and AI systems.

As more users spend time interacting with AI agents, being recognized in their answers becomes a new visibility channel. A good starting point is simple: test it. Create one or two explainer-style articles and measure the results.

## Strategy 2: Leverage Traditional SEO Tools

Traditional SEO tools like Yoast still work, and they work really well. Many people underestimate how useful these plugins actually are, but my experience says the opposite.

I've been working with them for many years, since 2017, and across every company and every article, we have used them to position content in search results. And consistently, they have delivered results.

A concrete example: about a year ago, a colleague wrote an article about deforestation. We applied the usual best practices — we positioned keywords, structured the article correctly, and optimized everything in WordPress with Yoast. Nothing extraordinary, just solid execution.

Today, that article appears in ChatGPT and Perplexity, and in GA4, it shows up as a primary traffic acquisition source.

**The takeaway is straightforward: When you write correctly and use these plugins properly, they still work.**

## Strategy 3: Prioritize Authentic Writing

One of the strongest signals today is still authentic writing: real people, real voice, real experience. LLMs tend to value content that feels genuine, grounded, and human — especially in a world where so much content is becoming synthetic.

That means we still need to do the traditional work: sharing real experiences, exploring real trends, addressing fundamental needs, and engaging with real communities. Content built from lived experience carries a depth that automated text cannot replicate.

If someone is searching for something specific — like natural ways to lose weight — and your article is based on real testing, real stories, and real people, it is far more likely to be surfaced by AI engines because it reflects authenticity and credibility.

This is where humans still have a clear advantage. AI cannot go out and interview communities, collect firsthand testimonies, or experience reality. That responsibility — and opportunity — belongs to us.

## Conclusion

To sum up, we can use these strategies to begin positioning ourselves within LLM-driven ecosystems. Marketers need to adapt to the evolving digital landscape, and this can be either a simple shift or a difficult one — it's up to us to make it a smoother path.

1. Structure content like Wikipedia — clear, factual, explanatory
2. Use proven SEO tools like Yoast to optimize content
3. Prioritize authentic, human-centered writing over automated content

The organizations that embrace these strategies will be better positioned to thrive in the AI-powered search era.
