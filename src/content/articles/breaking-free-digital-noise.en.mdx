## Understanding Digital Consumption

Can work, traffic, social media, noisy cities, and our busy lives consume our routines? That's a lot to manage! We usually spend so much time doing stuff that gives us a quick sense of satisfaction, but in reality, it's pure emptiness. That's how cheap dopamine works.

Nowadays, the world is full of quick dopamine that consumes us in all senses. Social media addiction is driven by dopamine release, similar to the effects of gambling or drug use. Platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram are designed to stimulate the brain's reward system through likes, shares, and retweets.

A couple of weeks ago, I read a newsletter from Cory Allen about the move to the information age. We're entering a quiet age. He talked about how exhausted and overloaded we are. That's why we should move into a quiet age, reconnect with the earth and nature again, and return to our nature.

## Returning to Our Roots

But how can we come back to our essence? That's the key question. I'm part of the last generation where our childhood was full of connection with other kids, playing on the playground, and interacting with the world around us. That's a huge advantage compared to the current generations, who are always in front of a screen.

It's not a secret that after the pandemic, the levels of anxiety and depression have been increasing, not only because of COVID-19 but also because of the huge exposure to devices and social media.

What does it mean for our daily lives? High exposure can affect our work and how we behave with others. Those are some reasons I decided to close my social media accounts and be with myself for a while.

## The Power of Social Media Detox

I have lived without social media for the past three months and experienced so much wellness. Social media detoxification has been linked to improved mood, reduced anxiety, better productivity, and enhanced sleep quality.

## Integrating Work and Purpose

Not only can a social media detox connect you to nature again, but it can also find ways to integrate our jobs into our daily routine. I work for a climate NGO as a Digital and Marketing Analytics Specialist. Approximately five years ago, I decided to move from the corporate world to start working in an impactful job beyond sales and money.

This shift allowed me to pursue more fulfilling pursuits that align with my values and contribute positively to the planet. Reducing my social media usage has given me more time to dedicate to productive endeavors that resonate with my commitment to environmental sustainability.

## A Sustainable Family Project

I want to share a story about a project my dad initiated during the pandemic. He owned a piece of land that had been overlooked for years. Reflecting on how the pandemic reshaped our lives, he envisioned creating a glamping site to offer urban dwellers a chance to reconnect with nature.

Throughout this process, I assisted him by managing the marketing and social media aspects and developing digital and offline strategies. As part of the eco-tourism objective, we included solar panels as the place's main energy source.

During this eco-friendly journey, we identified numerous benefits of utilizing solar energy:

- **Energy Independence**
- **Low Maintenance Requirements**
- **Improved Air Quality**
- **Conservation of Water Resources**

Guests responded enthusiastically, wanting to replicate these eco-friendly practices in their homes. This sustainable approach not only increased guest satisfaction but also led to a significant improvement in our Booking.com ratings.

## Connecting the Dots

In a world dominated by digital noise and constant connectivity, I decided to disconnect from social media, embarking on a journey toward a more balanced and meaningful life. This digital detox improved my mental well-being and allowed me to appreciate the beauty of reality often obscured by the digital world.

Transitioning from the corporate sector to a role in a climate-focused NGO enabled me to align my professional skills with my passion for environmental sustainability, deepening my connection to my work.

This experience reinforced my gratitude for having a profession that aligns with my life goals and personal mission, allowing me to contribute positively to the planet. By stepping away from superficial digital engagements, I rediscovered the importance of authentic experiences and purposeful work.
