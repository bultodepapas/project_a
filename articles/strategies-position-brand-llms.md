It is no secret that LLMs is dominating online marketing; to position our brands and accounts, we need to stay one step ahead of digital trends. SEO is the protagonist of the new era of web positioning in marketing. Also, terms such as GEO and AEO were born in these AI times. In one of my previous articles, "How is digital marketing related to the Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?" I discussed how those terms can help us define our digital marketing strategy. In this article, I want to discuss three strategies to appear in LLMs.

Let's start reviewing what an LLM is and how it works. For this, I always cite academic sources and literature to help us understand definitions. Based on Harnad (2025), the LLMS is defined as:

> "Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast text corpora using statistical learning over high-dimensional representations (e.g., vectors, large parameter spaces, next-token prediction), capable of generating human-like language outputs, despite lacking sensorimotor grounding or genuine understanding." (Harnad, 2025)

In simple words, thanks to LLMs, we can get easy, fast, and reliable (sometimes) information wherever we want. Some of the most famous LLMs, like GPT, Perplexity, and Gemini, among others, are good examples here.

One of the things we need to admit is that LLMs, instead of taking our jobs, is helping us create a new digital structure for marketers and be even more innovative, thinkers, strategic, and brilliant executors.

LLMs are essential for marketing because they enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing research. When combined with human work, LLMs improve the quality of insight generation, produce deeper and more informative qualitative data, support multiple stages of research (design, sampling, data collection, analysis), and enable scalable collaboration. Empirical evidence shows that AI–human hybrids outperform human-only approaches in producing marketing-relevant insights.

Let's call them collaborators for digital marketers, and I highlight how Arora, N., Chakraborty, I., & Nishimura, Y. (2025) use the term in their article, because it is entirely accurate. Moving beyond definitions and theory, I want to look at how LLMs can be optimized for SEO and content marketing.

## How LLMs Collaborate with Marketing and SEO Practice

Regarding the academic article: *Utilizing LLMs for Enhancing Search Engine Optimization Strategies in Digital Marketing*. Here we have some key highlights on how LLMs collaborates with SEO:

*   Content creation and optimization for SEO (high-quality content with optimized keywords)
*   Keyword research and targeting (identifying high-volume, low-competition keywords)
*   Generation and optimization of meta descriptions and titles
*   Technical SEO support (site architecture, loading speed, mobile optimization)
*   Improvement of user engagement (reduced bounce rates, increased time on page)
*   Increase in organic traffic performance
*   Improvement in keyword rankings

Based on this brief introduction to this topic, here are the three main tips to position your brand/account in LLMs:

### 1. Adopt a Wikipedia-style structure focused on clarity and factual explanation rather than extended narrative.

A practical way to improve brand visibility in the age of AI is to **structure content like Wikipedia**: clear, factual, and explanatory rather than long and narrative-heavy.

If you want your brand to appear in LLM answers (for example, a beverage company wanting its drink mentioned by ChatGPT), your content should look like a simple article that explains what the product is, what makes it special, and why it is different. Wikipedia does this exceptionally well through structured sections and easy-to-digest explanations.

People are no longer reading long theoretical articles. They consume **straightforward, concise explainer content**. This format works better for both humans and AI systems.

As more users spend time interacting with AI agents, being recognized in their answers becomes a new visibility channel. A good starting point is simple: test it. Create one or two explainer-style articles and measure the results.

### 2. Leverage traditional SEO tools (such as Yoast) to improve your articles' visibility in search results.

Traditional SEO tools like Yoast still work, and they work really well. Many people underestimate how useful these plugins actually are, but my experience says the opposite.

I've been working with them for many years, since 2017, and across every company and every article, we have used them to position content in search results. And consistently, they have delivered results.

A concrete example: about a year ago, a colleague wrote an article about deforestation. We applied the usual best practices—we positioned keywords, structured the article correctly, and optimized everything in WordPress with Yoast. Nothing extraordinary, just solid execution.

Today, that article appears in ChatGPT and Perplexity, and in GA4, it shows up as a primary traffic acquisition source.

The takeaway is straightforward:
When you write correctly and use these plugins properly, they still work.

### 3. Prioritize authentic writing: real people, real voice, not AI-generated text.

One of the strongest signals today is still authentic writing: real people, real voice, real experience. LLMs tend to value content that feels genuine, grounded, and human—especially in a world where so much content is becoming synthetic.

That means we still need to do the traditional work: sharing real experiences, exploring real trends, addressing fundamental needs, and engaging with real communities. Content built from lived experience carries a depth that automated text cannot replicate.

If someone is searching for something specific—like natural ways to lose weight—and your article is based on real testing, real stories, and real people, it is far more likely to be surfaced by AI engines because it reflects authenticity and credibility.

This is where humans still have a clear advantage. AI cannot go out and interview communities, collect firsthand testimonies, or experience reality. That responsibility—and opportunity—belongs to us. And if we continue creating content this way, we strengthen both our relevance and our visibility in an AI-driven ecosystem.

## Conclusion

To sum up, we can use these strategies to begin positioning ourselves within LLM-driven ecosystems. Marketers need to adapt to the evolving digital landscape, and this can be either a simple shift or a difficult one—it's up to us to make it a smoother path.
